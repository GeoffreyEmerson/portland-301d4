# Lab 07: Portfolio + Functional Programming

Scopes and closures and IIFE's, oh my!

Apply functional programming concepts to your portfolio codebase.

- Eliminate all `for` loops.
- Use `.map()` where you are transforming one collection into another.
- Enclose the contents of each script file in an IIFE that exports any interface methods.
- Use templates to avoid repetition of HTML structure. Use `.map()` to convert collections of data into collections of DOM nodes.
- Think of a useful way to use `.reduce()`. Maybe you want to put some "fun facts and stats" in your footer, or on a separate page, like funStats.html?

## Git Workflow
Make sure your commits for previous labs have been merged into your master branch, then create a new branch for this lab. Commit changes frequently using concise, meaningful commit messages.

When you're done, issue a final PR from your new branch to your master branch.
