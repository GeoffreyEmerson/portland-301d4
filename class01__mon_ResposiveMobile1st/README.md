# Class 01: Responsive Design, Mobile-first, and SMACSS

Let's develop some coding skills for mobile/responsive design!

## Pair Lab: Blog Web App
Take the starter code for a web application that renders blog articles in a browser, an work with a partner to improve the blog app by making it responsive, so that it hides the main navigation menu under a "hamburger" link in small (narrow) browser viewports, and shows a row of tab-like links in wider viewports.

## Solo Lab: Portfolio App
Take what you leared during your pair lab and apply the same concepts to your "portfolio" web application.
