# Changes
Changes discussed in Class 03.

## Portfolio app (solo lab)
- Portfolio labs for the entire week will now be due at 9 am on Monday of the **following week**, but it's highly recommended that you finish by 11:59 pm on Sat; this is to encourage you to set aside time on Sunday to read/sandbox to prep for Monday's class.
- If you submit at the end of the week, you may submit your portfolio as a single PR (as opposed to a PR every day). Your "end of the week" PR does not need to separate each day's work like your blog app needs to do, but should meet all of the requirements listed in the entire week's worth of portfolio assignments. Optionally, you can "mix and match" -- you can submit one day's work as a PR, then combine two days' requirements into another PR, etc. But be sure to submit a comment in your PR request that specifies which day's worth of labwork is covered by that PR (e.g., "This PR satisfies portfolio lab requirements from classes 07 thru 09, inclusive.").
- Every day, you are **strongly** encouraged to add at least **code comments** to your portfolio code, *even if you don't have time to write actual code*. The comments should contain a URL of blog app code that correctly implements the feature(s) you need for your portfolio, and your own notes on how/what you'll use the feature for (e.g., "Use handlebars templating to show my work experience. Put work experience strings in an array of object, one object per job. Working templating/handlebars.js code is at http://www.github.com/userName/repoName/tree/class04/app.js and index.html")
  - URL of blog app code that contains the needed feature for the day
  - Comment on how to use that feature, specific to the portfolio app
- Each day's portfolio work will still have a suggested deadline of 9 am the follow day.

## Sanboxes/points
- Sandboxes: Aggregate apps into fewer files; have a few progressions
- Require only X of Y sandboxes. Weigh each app w/ points; set min. thresh, above the thresh is E.C.

## Lecture
4:00 (or 4:30) to 5:00pm
- "Mini-lecture" Intro/motivation for new code feature(s),
- Mob code one sandbox app for the night's reading.
