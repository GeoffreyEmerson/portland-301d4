# MVC blog
Work with the provided starter code to add structure and functionality a basic Blog web site.

The code has some unfinished features. Your help is needed to complete it!

Search through the code for:

 `// TODO: ...`

comments, where features should be. Replace the comments and any related pseudo-code with real, working code.

## Getting started with pair programming
Work in pairs. Take turns as "driver" and "navigator".

Here is a recommended workflow:

1. Navigator ("Nav"): create a new repo or folder in your GitHub account for this blog app. You will use this repo/folder as you evolve your app during the next 3 weeks.
1. Nav: Seed your new repo/folder with the provided starter code (**copy** the starter code from your clone of the course repo), then git a-c-p.
1. Driver: fork the Navigator's new repo and clone it.
1. Nav: navigate as the Driver works on her/his fork of your new repo. Tackle all `TODO` items in the starter code.
1. Driver: a-c-p regularly during development.
1. Switch roles after every few `TODO` items are done.
1. Driver: When the assignment is done, submit a PR to the Nav's repo.
