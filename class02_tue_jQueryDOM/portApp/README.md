# Portfolio Lab Assignment: jQuery DOM manipulation

## User Stories: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Let these user stories guide your development:
1. As a developer, I want portfolio items to be displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
1. As a visitor, I want the portfolio to show the newest projects on top so that I can easily see the developers recent work.
1. As a visitor, I want relative timestamps on projects to give me a idea of how many days ago something was created.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
- Use good Object Oriented code: Create a constructor function for projects.
- Leave as little in the `window` (global) namespace as possible: attach functions to objects, etc.
- Use jQuery's .clone() to create new articles, and fill them in with content.
- Your Project prototype should have a `.toHtml()` function that adds new data to the DOM.
- Make your app look good; include basic styles: a css reset, portions of content centered in the page, reasonable margins, etc.
