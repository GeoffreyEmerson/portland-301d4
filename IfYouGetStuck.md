# If You Get Stuck While Coding...

1. Look up information online, and sandbox unfamiliar coding features to understand how to use them. Read at least three web pages to try to find a solution.
- Debugging: Try, at a minimum, each of the following methods that are applicable to your situation; in some cases you may need to combine methods to effectively debug:
  - Do static analysis on your code - syntax, variable names, execution flow.
  - Use Chrome Developer Tools to set break points and single step through your code as it executes.
  - Add console.log() calls to your code and examine console output.
  - Comment out sections of code to try to isolate the bug(s).
- Ask another student(s) for help. Students can also learn significantly by teaching.
- During help, if there's a whiteboard request, the help session will be time-limited to 5 mins to prevent other students from waiting unreasonably long.

Try to solve your problem using method #1 below. If that fails, try method #2, etc.
Spend up to 15 minutes on #1 thru #5. Methods:
1. "Toaster" check: What git branch are you on? What file is your editor *actually* editing? What is the webroot of your server?
What server is your browser *actually* connected to?
- Use the CDT debugger. **Learn CDT**. console.log works sometimes but is clumsy and **slow**.
- "Hack-and-slash commenting", short-circuit logic, dummy vals, etc.; then sandbox "in-place", or just sandbox separately.
- Look online. MDN, jquery.com, Stackoverflow, Google, etc.
- Think carefully through these questions:
  - What result did you expect?
  - What is the actual result?
  - If there's an error message, what is it?  Where is the error (What file? What line number?)
  - What steps have you taken to address the issue?
  1. First I...
  1. Then I...
- Ask a classmate. Be ready to show that you tried methods 1 thru 5 *before* asking classmate for help.
- Ask a TA. Show your search effort.
- Ask an instructor
  - 15 minute stuck rule
  - 5 minute wait rule
