# If You Get Stuck While Coding...

Try to solve your problem using method #1 below. If that fails, try method #2, etc.
Spend up to 15 minutes total on methods #1 thru #5. Methods:

1. "Toaster" checks:
   - What git branch are you on?
   - What file is your editor *actually* editing?
   - What is the webroot of your server?
   - What server is your browser *actually* connected to?
   - When your code includes other files, are filenames mis-spelled? Are they included in the right order?
- Use Chrome Developer Tools to set break points and single step through your code as it executes. Sometimes console.log works ok, but is generally clumsy and **slow** to find bugs.
- Use "Hack-and-slash commenting", short-circuit logic, dummy values, and other methods, then test a feature "in-place"; or just sandbox a feature.
- Look online. MDN, jquery.com, Stackoverflow, Google, etc. Look at a minimum of *three* sources.
- Answer these questions in your head; you may want to type or write down your answers:
  - What result did you expect?
  - What is the actual result?
  - Did you look at the error message(s)? If there's an error message, what is it?  Where is the error -- what file and what line number?
- What steps have you taken to address the issue?
  1. First I...
  1. Then I...
- Ask a classmate. Be ready to show that you tried methods 1 thru 5 *before* asking classmate for help.
- Ask a TA. Show your search effort.
- Ask an instructor for help.

## Five Minute Waiting Rule
To be fair to your classmates, if another student is waiting for help, teaching staff must help the next student within 5 minutes.
