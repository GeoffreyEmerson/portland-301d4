# Lab 05: Portfolio

Work in pairs to improve your portfolio.

No need to add each other as collaborators, just share a link to your portfolio repo with your partner.

Start with code review. Spend the first 30 minutes looking over your partner's portfolio code. Look for opportunities to improve the code base according to the best practices and concepts that we've covered in class so far.

A good code review has these features:
- Respects the effort that went into the current product
- Embraces and congratulates best practices
- Focuses on the code, not the code's author
- Asks "Why is it this way?" rather than criticizing
- Seeks to make the code more understandable
- Nitpicks the details. Yes, nitpicking in this context is good - it helps to improve coding practices. But be nice when nitpicking.

Create descriptive **GitHub Issues** for the most important issues that you feel should be addressed. In the issue, describe what you see, ask clarifying questions as needed, and link to the related line of code in the repo.

Once you both have a few issues logged, start writing code together.

The Driver will work on the Navigator's codebase. The Navigator can talk them through what is where, and how changes should be made, and the Driver can implement them.

Switch after you've worked through a few issues. Switch back again (and again) if time allows.

## Submit
1. URL of the GitHub Issues page of your partner's repo where you created a bunch of feedback.
2. URL of the most recent commit you made that is associated with closing out one of the issues your partner submitted. Use it commit messages that look like "fix #1" to automatically close an Issue.
3. How long did this lab take?
4. What did you learn in this process?
