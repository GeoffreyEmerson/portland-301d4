 # Class 05 (Week 1, Fri): marked.js, highlight.js

Let's build a "new article form" for the blog app to let authors create new blog articles.

For your portfolio app, you'll pair up to review each other's code and make improvements.

## Review

### Blog App
Pair review, 20 mins. Objectives are to understand the following:
- How to use handlebars.js
  - Template format
  - Data format
  - What are .compile()'s I/O data types? How do you use it?

### Prep-work for markdown.js, highlight.js
Pair review, 20 mins. Objectives are to understand the following:
- What steps required, at a high level, to convert Markdown to HTML and render the result?
- What is "hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();" used for?
- What does "hljs.highlightBlock(block)" do? What data type is the input? The output?

### Discuss
