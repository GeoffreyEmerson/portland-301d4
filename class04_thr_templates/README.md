# Class 04 (Week 1, Thr): Templates &amp; Typography
Templates have some advantages over direct DOM manipulation. Leverage those strengths in the blog app and your portfolio app! Templating with handlebars.js specifically can be quite useful, and is even perceived by some as extremely invigorating and pleasantly memorable.

As our code gets more complex, this is a good time to make sure our CSS styles are well-organized. Let's adopt the SMACSS system for keeping everything in its proper place.
