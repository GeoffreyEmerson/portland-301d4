# jQuery Events in the View

Use the provided starter code as a reference to add event handling to your basic blog app.

The code has unfinished features, and your help is needed to complete it! The blog should end up looking something like [THIS](http://hijk.it/image/1C3V1S1r3H1n/Screen%20Shot%202015-11-23%20at%2012.21.45%20PM.png).

Search through the code for:

`TODO: ...`

comments, where features should be. Replace the comments and any related pseudo-code with real, working code.

## Pair programming
Work in pairs. Take turns as "driver" and "navigator" ("Nav").

1. Analyze Starter Code<br>
This task is to help you improve your ability to analyze code, even when it contains unfamiliar features. Don't only code fearlessly; learn also to *analyze* code fearlessly - gain the ability to look at advanced code without feeling intimidated.<br>
**Both**: read through the starter code. There's a lot of new code, and it's dense. As a team, review the code and sandbox at least **four** features that neither of you is familiar/comfotable with. Drive for two features and navigate for the other two. **Nav**: decide what feature to sandbox and how the sandbox app should be implemented. Each time you finish *navigating* a sandbox app, have Driver issue a PR to *your* repo's master branch, then switch roles.<br>
  Spend 45 minutes on this task (code review + sandboxing) to learn about unfamiliar objects and/or methods.

1. Set up Repo<br>
**Nav**: Use GitHub to create a new branch that continues your blog app development where the previous day's lab left off.<br>
**Driver** fork Nav's repo and clone it and make sure you switch to the new branch in your local workspace.

1. Incorporate starter code<br>
**Nav**: Navigate while **Driver** works on the fork. Tell Driver what parts of starter code to add to the fork and how to modify it to fit your existing app. Remember to add all `TODO` comments/pseudo-code.

1. Fix TODO's<br>
**Driver**: Use Atom's "Find in Project" feature to generate a list of all `TODO1 items.<br>
**Nav**: Tackle all `TODO` items. Right after coding a TODO item, test and debug your code.<br>
**Driver** do git **a-c-p** frequently during development.

1. Pull Request<br>
**Driver**: When this lab is done, make a PR to Nav's repo.

- How much time you spent on this lab
- URLs
   - PRs for the **sandboxes** you navigated.
   - PR for the blog app.
