# Class 06 Portfolio assignment

## User Stories: MVP
1. As a developer, I want to store my project data in a .json file, so that I can keep it organized.
- As a developer, I want to retrieve that source data file asynchronously, so that my app logic gets the data just when I need it.

### User Stories: Stretch Goals
- As a reader, I only want to have to fetch data when it's updated (and keep it cached locally), so that I don't make unneeded AJAX calls.

## Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric
- Transfer your collection of data over to a .json file, replacing your original file.
- Continue to follow good SMACSS principles.
- Be sure to use the correct jQuery method for each AJAX call.
- Be thoughtful when functions are executed asynchronously. This is a major source of bugs!

## Git Workflow
Make sure your commits for previous labs have been merged into your master branch, then create a new branch for this lab. Commit changes frequently, and use concise, meaningful commit messages.

When you're done, issue a PR from your new branch to your master branch.

## Submit
1. GitHub URL for your PR.
2. Answers to these questions:
   - How much time did you spend on this lab?
